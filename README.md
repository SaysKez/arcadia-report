## What is The Arcadia Report?
The Arcadia Report is an immersive murder mystery unique to you, transforming your city into an escape room. You donâ€™t read about a detective, you are the detective. Play anywhere, anytime as mystery invades reality. Travel to real world locations, unlock clues, and uncover the secrets of Arcadia as you delve into corrupted records of a failed startup with murderous consequences.

## The Story So Far
The Arcadia Report is the corrupted database of a failed startup. Someone is reigniting their quest to build an algorithm to solve crimes and attempting to crowdsource justice. You've been selected to take justice into your hands. It's up to you to piece together clues from the corrupted files to solve the mystery and uncover the truth as people connected to The Report turn up dead. Can you restore Arcadia and stop a serial killer?

### Prompts
**NOTE:** Due to the limits of the prototype, not all potential avenues of investigation are currently built. If you get stuck, it's the prototype's fault. Follow the prompts below to get the fullest taste of Case 1. 


1. Try reading the case file and following the lead on the suspect.
2. The suspect's emails may reveal more.
3. Can't unlock the victim's email? Try accessing the local files on the desktop.

**Once you unlock the location files:**
1. Does anyone look familiar in the CCTV footage? Add it to the report if you think so!
2. One of the files you find might have information that will unlock the victim's email.

**Once you unlock the emails:**
1. Is the victim allergic to anything? That could be a means for a murder.
2. Once you've added to files to the case report, you can skip to the end to see the resolution of the case.
